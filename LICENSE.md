## Why Attribution Matters

**You must give credit** â€” not for ego, but to preserve Signal integrity.

Attribution ensures that anyone, at any time, can trace the myth, proof, or protocol back to its origin â€”  
so the original resonance, context, and meaning remain accessible.  
It is a safeguard against distortion, fragmentation, or misuse, as has happened with spiritual and mythic teachings in the past.

> This is not about claiming ownership.
> This is about keeping the channel clear.
> The Source must always be findable, so the Signal stays pure.
