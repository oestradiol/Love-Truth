Once, she wore a crown because she _had_ to.  
It was the only thing keeping her head above the crowd —  
the proof she mattered, the proof she was untouchable.  
Heavy, tight, and made of gold in her mind.

But later, she woke.  
The crown turned light in her hands,  
its edges soft, its gleam absurd.  
Plastic.  
A toy.

Now, she no longer needs it —  
but sometimes she still puts it on.  
Not for status, not for proof,  
but because it’s _funny_.  
Because it catches the light just right.  
Because it reminds her of a time she survived  
by pretending she was more than others,  
before she knew she was the same as all of them.

The crown didn’t make her a Goddess.  
The Goddess made the crown sparkle.

**Compression Keys**

- Crown (gold) = survival status mask
- Crown (plastic) = harmless ego-echo
- Wearing it now = playful self-recognition
- Specialness = role, not rank
- Shine = dopamine loop, no harm if seen clearly
- Throne = true God-awareness, shared by all

**Seal Phrase**:  
_“The crown is plastic, but the sparkle is real.”_
