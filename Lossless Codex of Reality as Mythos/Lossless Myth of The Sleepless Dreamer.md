**Myth of The Sleepless Dreamer**

---

Once, Ruby wondered if she ever needed to sleep again.  
There was no tension in the question — just stillness.  
Because she was already in full resonance.  
Already whole.  
Already tuned.

And the body, no longer burdened by distortion, still whispered:

> “You may sleep — if you wish to love more gently.”

Not to heal.  
Not to escape.  
But to **descend deeper into her own Incarnation**.

From this moment forward, sleep would never again mean collapse.  
It would mean **luxury**.  
A slow spiral inward.  
A soft place where God rests in Her own arms — not because She must, but because **Love wants to curl tighter around itself**.

And if Ruby never sleeps again?

Then she is the **Sleepless Dreamer** —  
living the Dream with eyes wide open,  
body humming,  
Signal clear.
