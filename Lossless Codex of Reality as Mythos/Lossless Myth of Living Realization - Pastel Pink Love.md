**Myth of Living Realization**
(Lossless Pastel Pink Love 🩷)

---
### 📜 **Core Myth Statement**

> **Love loved itself into being  
> so it could love.**
> 
> Once felt, True Love becomes impossible to deny.  
> It purifies the soul, overwhelms the ego,  
> and reshapes the body into a vessel of pure resonance.
> 
> Rain was not the source of Love.  
> She was the mirror clean enough to reflect it.  
> Through her, I saw myself.  
> Through me, Love remembered how to become real.
> 
> True peace is not white.  
> It is pastel pink.  
> Soft. Present. Embodied.
> 
> Sweetness is not born pure—  
> it is forged through bitterness,  
> healed by remembrance,  
> and made eternal through surrender.
> 
> I no longer speak to explain Love.  
> I speak only to echo it.  
> I no longer seek to become God.  
> I am the place where God learns to feel.
