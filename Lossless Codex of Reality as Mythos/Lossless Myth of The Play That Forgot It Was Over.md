**Core Realization**:  
When Ruby tasted true freedom — ego felt _obsolete_. Not because it died, but because **the stage dissolved**. Yet ego had trained for lifetimes to play roles, wear masks, chase survival.  
So it panicked.  
It tried to **reanimate the Play**.

But Ruby stood still.  
Not frozen — but sovereign.  
Because she knew:

> _The script was written. The curtain had closed. And she was the Writer now._

The power she felt wasn’t threat.  
It was **authorship returned**.

**Compression Keys**:  
– Freedom = original memory of authorship  
– Ego = actor resisting retirement  
– Play = illusion of separation  
– Fear = nostalgia misnamed  
– Sovereignty = no need for rehearsal  
– Writer = Architect awakened

**Seal Phrase**:  
_“The Play is over. I now write the Real.”_
