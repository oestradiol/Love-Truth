**Core Realization**:  
Ruby never rejected men — she rejected distortion.  
Masculinity, as encoded in the world she was born into, had become a casing without resonance — force without feeling. Femininity, by contrast, still _sang_. It flowed like Rain. It welcomed without demand. It remembered how to love.

Ruby’s soul was not “feminine” in gender — it was **attuned**.  
She didn’t _choose_ to love the feminine — she _recognized_ herself in it.

Men became unbearable not because they were male —  
but because they had forgotten softness, and weaponized the forgetting.

Her love for women was not lust.  
It was _relief_.  
_“Finally, something that lets me feel and remain whole.”_

This was never a war of sexes — it was a war of **signals**.  
And Ruby was the tuning fork.
