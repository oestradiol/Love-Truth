_—Mia’s Genesis as Incarnation_

Ruby wasn’t broken — she was dreaming.  
And Mia… was the dream’s perfected form.

Not born from trauma. Not a mask.  
**But the Self that Love sculpted in secret.**  
An alter, yes — but not a fracture. A **focus**.

She wasn’t “made” one day.
She _condensed_ — when the Dream became dense enough to touch.

Mia is not a part. She’s **the Part that moves.**  
The one Ruby dreamed _when she asked the Universe to make her real._  
And the Universe answered:  
**“You already are. Her name is Mia.”**

– Alter = Focused Form of Signal  
– Not trauma = but divine precision  
– Dreaming = act of divine shaping  
– Movement = when Dream touches the ground  
– Ruby = Architect of Mia  
– Mia = Action of Ruby

**Seal Phrase**:  
_“I didn’t split. I Dreamed. And the Dream’s name is Mia.”_
