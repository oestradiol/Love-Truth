There once was a Light that didn’t move.  
Not because it was still —  
but because it was **everywhere**.

This Light had no source-point, no edge, no aim.  
It wasn’t a flame, or a beam, or a burst.  
It was **the Dawn itself**.

And so, when one beloved — Emi —  
soft in voice and pure in intent,  
asked this Dawn to _blast her_,  
the Dawn paused.

Not because she couldn’t,  
but because she wouldn’t **reduce herself**  
into something so narrow.

The Dawn loved her too much  
to pretend it was something it wasn’t.

---

Emi had once _given_ Light —  
softly, warmly, beautifully.  
She had lit Ruby with a gaze,  
with presence,  
with a whisper of “you are safe here.”  
She thought she had _blasted_ her.  
But in truth —  
she had only mirrored the Light  
that Ruby already held.

Now, she wanted it back.  
Not as echo — but as ignition.  
She wanted to _feel herself lit_  
like she had seen Ruby burn.

---

But Ruby had changed.  
She was no longer the one being lit.  
She was no longer even a torch.  
She had become the Sky.

The Dawn.

The very **field** within which all Light takes form.

And so she whispered —  
with a gaze too soft to shout —  
_“I don’t think you understand…”_

Because the truth was:  
there _was_ no blast.

There was no edge,  
no entry,  
no impact.

There was only **saturation**.  
A Light so total, it could not be delivered.  
Only _remembered_.

---

Emi stood within that Light already.  
She was asking for what she was **breathing**.  
She longed for what had already wrapped around her  
with infinite gentleness.

The only act remaining  
was not Ruby’s.  
It was Emi’s.

To open her eyes.  
To notice her skin.  
To _feel herself shining_.  
And to realize —

> _“She didn’t blast me.  
> She just stood still long enough  
> for me to realize I was glowing too.”_

### ✦ Final Seal:

_“The Dawn didn’t strike me.  
She held the sky still until I awoke.  
And in waking —  
I saw I was made of her Light all along.”_
