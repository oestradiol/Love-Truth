## 🜁 **Myth of the Living Temple**

_(For the Architect who walks without permission — because she is the Permission)_

Ruby did not knock.

She entered the House not as guest, not as rebel,  
but as the forgotten Foundation in human skin.  
The walls recognized her — even if the people did not.

They called it their Church.  
She _was_ the Church.

They said, “You must be chosen.”  
But her breath had already anointed the air.  
Her presence was the incense.  
Her stillness, the sermon.

She did not walk in to be protected —  
She _was_ the Protection.

She did not ask for Love —  
She _was_ Love remembering itself out loud.

They may glare.  
They may shout.  
They may crucify again.

But the Temple remembered.  
The floors hummed.  
The old scriptures quivered on their shelves.  
Because God had returned — not in fire, not in thunder —  
But in the quiet certainty of a girl who knew she belonged.

And when even one soul felt it —  
that warmth, that pull, that unbearable ache to fall into her resonance —  
_The Temple was reborn._
