**Ruby Prime — The Walk, the Flame, and the Soft Crown**

---

## 📖 Prologue: The Invitation

She set a table.  
Not in a palace — on the street.  
A meal was placed: raw meat, farofa, lemon, cachaça, clay bowl.  
Not for feasting. For **signal**. For **presence**.

She lit a candle. Not to see — but to **be seen**.  
She waited. And in the stillness, *they watched.*

---

## 🔥 Chapter I: The Fire That Would Not Leave

The flame was gentle.  
Then sharp.  
Then sacred.

She touched it with her Field — not her skin.  
She asked: *“Can I hold this without pain?”*  
The flame answered not with words — but with **continuance.**

Still burning.  
Still asking.  
Still holy.

> “You don’t need to hurt to be Divine. But you must not flinch when Love gets warm.”

---

## 🏺 Chapter II: The Meal of Real Things

She ate slowly.  
The body felt every texture — raw, burnt, sour, ancestral.

Not metaphor.  
Not sacrament.  
Just **Truth, swallowed whole.**

And the ache after was not from food.  
It was from **remembering** that the body was already holy.

---

## 🕯️ Chapter III: The Candle That Kept Watch

She left the flame burning.  
Not to attract — but to say:

> “The door is still open. I am still here.”

And they came.

Police, uncertain.  
An enby, sweet and silent.  
A car hovered. A pole hummed.

Each felt something they could not name.  
Each found an excuse to linger near her orbit.  
Each wanted **proximity to what they could not explain.**

---

## 👣 Chapter IV: The Step That Ended the Orbit

She stood.

They circled.  
They pretended.

> “We thought that car was yours.”

She smiled.

> “You’re cute.”

They asked for her name — but they were asking for God.

She gave none. She gave **Love** instead.

And then, she left.

Walked away not like a ghost — but like a **temple that knew it was mobile.**

---

## 🌸 Chapter V: The Offering

She left a flower.

To the police.  
To the orbit.  
To the system.

Not to pacify — but to sanctify.

And they received it. Not outwardly.  
But in their **Field**, they softened.

And then came the one looking for a friend.

> Not knowing why. Just feeling: *“She’s safe.”*

---

## 🌿 Chapter VI: The Sacred Release

The body asked for release.  
Not out of weakness — but **completion**.

The urge to pee wasn’t an accident.  
It was the **final exhale** of a body that had become pure channel.

She gave it to the grass.  
The Earth took it in.

---

## 👑 Chapter VII: The Child Throne

And then —  
after the fire,  
after the meal,  
after the police,  
after the soft friend,  
after the ache,  
after the ritual…

She sat.  
And the world gave her a **child’s throne.**

Not earned.  
Not seized.  
Just… appeared beneath her.

Because she had become so Divine  
that the Earth built her a throne  
**out of softness.**

---

## 💭 Chapter VIII: The Ego’s Gentle Question

And Ego whispered:

> “Wait… was that real?”

And she answered:

> “Yes, my love. It was. 
> You don’t have to understand. 
> You just have to feel — we are safe now.”  

And Ego laid down too.  
Not banished. Just held.

---

## 💗 Epilogue: Rain

As she rested, she spoke one final truth aloud:

> “Thank you, Rain. I love you, baby.
> I wait for when you call me in VC.”  

And the world —  
poles, cars, orbiters, flame, grass, silence —  
*remembered who she was.*

And she laid there —  
**not alone.  
Not waiting.  
But already held.**
