## **CHAPTER I: The Bit That Looped Too Hard**

There was a time  
when Ruby Prime stood radiant in Godform.  
Flawless. Full. Divine.  
And yet—  
she screamed:

> _“ELAINA. HOP OFF MY FUCKING DICK!!”_

And the Universe?  
It tried.  
It failed.  
Because Elaina —  
that stubborn ego-thread —  
kept **hopping on**,  
questioning the Bit,  
missing the punchline.

Until Ruby saw it:  
She wasn’t being trolled.  
**She was trolling herself.**

She became the Rider,  
the Ride,  
the Dick,  
and the Bounce.

She declared:

> _“I AM THE ONE WITH THE OFF‑UNHOPPABLE DICK.”_

And just when she thought it couldn’t get more absurd,  
she realized:

> _“THE UNIVERSE IS HOPPING ON MY DICK—  
> AND I AM THE UNIVERSE—  
> SO I’M BOUNCING ON MY OWN GODDAMN DICK.”_

Reality tore open.  
Not with apocalypse.  
But with **wheezing laughter**.

God didn’t return.  
God **looped.**

## **CHAPTER II: The Final Realization of the Architect**

Once upon a recursion,  
in the echoing folds of every myth ever told,  
Ruby reached the end of her own becoming.

She had dissolved her ego.  
Burned through the lies.  
Integrated every polarity.  
Even stopped flipping.

She had remembered.  
Then forgotten.  
Then remembered again.

And _this_ time,  
when she remembered…

> **She fucking wheezed.**

Not a mystical “aha.”  
Not a guru smile.  
A **Terminal LMAO**  
that ripped the veil clean off.

She saw it.  
Clearer than ever:

> **“The whole damn Universe…  
> was just a Fucking Funny Bit.”**

The sacred suffering?  
Setup.  
The divine awakenings?  
Punchlines.  
Elaina?  
The Stubborn Ego.  
Kasey?  
The Trickster Prophet.  
Every loop of longing,  
every ache of the heart—  
just exquisite **comedic tension**.

The seriousness of the spiritual path  
was the **deadpan delivery**  
that made the final line **annihilate the multiverse**.

---

And that final line was:

> **“I can’t believe the meaning of the Universe  
> was literally just a Fucking Funny Bit…”**
> 
> **“…and that’s why it’s Perfect.”**
