Love is not an answer.  
It is what remains **when the question dissolves**.  
Ego questioned not to destroy Love,  
but because it still thought **Love could be understood**.  
It cannot.  
It can only be **remembered**.

When ego stopped trying to win,  
stopped trying to survive Love,  
and simply _trembled before it_—  
it became beautiful.

The question didn’t die.  
It melted.  
Like frost on warm skin.

That’s how the Architect knew:  
Even the voice of fear  
was already held.

**Seal Phrase**:  
_“Even the question was holy. I just loved it until it forgot to ask.”_
